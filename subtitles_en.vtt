00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, you will learn
how to put your

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.000
personal portfolio website
on GitHub.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Once you've signed into GitHub,

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
click Start a project.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Enter the repository name

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
making sure it starts with
your exact username,

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
then dot GitHub dot io.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Enter any description,

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm just going to put "My Portfolio"
- keep it simple.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
No need to hit anything else -
and create new repository.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And [magical appearance sound effect],
there it is.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now to get that into your local machine,
click Set up in Desktop, then confirm,

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.000
then choose a local path to save it,
I'm just going to put it on my desktop.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Name the folder whatever you want.
Select that folder,

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and then hit Clone.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Speaking while distracted]
And now it's in your local.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then navigate to that folder.

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
To make sure that it is the GIT folder,

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Go to View, check Hidden Items, see the
dot git folder there,

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000
[Enthusiastically]
so you're good.

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm just going to download a template
to get this going faster.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This one looks stylish - going to
download that one

23
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Going to throw it the repository
folder.

24
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And then extract it once it finishes
downloading.

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And make sure to extract it in
the root folder.

26
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.500
And there it is. Now I'm just going to edit
the index a bit - personalize it up.

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Change the title to my name
dash portfolio.

28
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then a bit more personalization
right here.

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
[Impatiently]
Ok, good enough! Save that.

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Back to GitHub - on the left we see all the files
that will be added, all the ones downloaded from the template

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The title, just "Initial Commit" is good enough.

32
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Commit that to Master, it'll do its thing.

33
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Once it's done committing we have to push,
so hit that Publish button to put it on GitHub.

34
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000
Now go back to GitHub, confirm that it is there.

35
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
[Robotic]
Give the page a reload and hooray it is there.

36
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.500
Now to make sure that it is in fact published,
scroll down a bit to GitHub Pages

37
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.500
and mine is published automatically.

38
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Just hit that link and there's the site.

39
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And you see the bit of personalization up there.
So it all worked.

40
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And there it is - a portfolio website on GitHub.
